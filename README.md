# MidtermProject

BI Project that focuses on analysing the narratives in cinema with female leads. For example its hard to find in Oldschool Hollywood, current cinema Hollywood, Mubi, or Netflix with the authentic and engaging underrepresented stories which can be on the rise soon. Its goal its to cater to the alternative Berlin audience scene and create a community through a community app of people who track their discoveries through subjects they like, which helps people to connect in less conventional ways. Helping them prompt the conversation in a unbiased manner. Or in simple term Bechdel yourself up.

Analysing full dataset of Box Office Performance of Movies with Female Leads and part of Movie Bechdel Test Scores (extract the part between years 1970 and 2013). The movie titles with highest potential for being unbiased entries, will be selected as a guideline to analyse further, 

Further ideas for research end project: if possible with NLP techniques to extract phrases and dynamics that the end-goal app would be prompting.

Goal: Define the project scope and goals and begin data gathering and processing.

- Investigate the data and prepare a plan for data cleaning and organizing.

- Prepare a summary of the findings and insights.

Deliverables: A merged dataset and a set of visualizations with a summary of findings document.

Day 3-4: Wednesday and Thursday

Goal: Prepare a well-documented and organized presentation of the data analysis process and results in Tableau.
